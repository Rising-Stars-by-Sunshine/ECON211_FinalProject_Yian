# ECON211_PS2_Yian

## Description

This repository is the problem set 2 for the course ECON211.
This project aims to improve heart failure prediction by integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into a binary classification model. Focused on healthcare, the research utilizes machine learning algorithms and a diverse dataset to enhance transparency and interpretability. The outcomes are expected to yield a refined predictive model, fostering collaboration between healthcare professionals and AI. The intellectual merits lie in advancing healthcare AI, offering transparent and trustworthy models, while the practical impact empowers clinicians with a tool that predicts heart failure and provides understandable insights for improved patient outcomes.

## Self-Introduction
### **Education**
- Yian Pei is currently pursuing a dual degree program at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and Duke University, with an expected graduation in July 2025.

### **Research**
- Yian Pei gained valuable research experience at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO) from July 2019 to August 2021. Working under the guidance of Dr. Jine Wang, Yian actively contributed to a research project focused on the selection of a DNA aptamer for the recognition of Aflatoxin B1 mycotoxin. They were instrumental in developing a fluorescent aptasensor designed for the detection of Aflatoxin B1 in food samples.

### **Professional Experience**
- Yian's professional journey included a summer internship at Ainstec from June 2023 to August 2023, where they served as an Algorithm Engineer Intern. During their time at Ainstec, they led a project in point cloud completion and conducted extensive research to successfully implement dense point-to-point correspondence.

- Additionally, Yian served as a Student Research Intern (Bioinformatics) at SINANO in the same period, where they specialized in image processing and data analysis using ImageJ. They achieved a remarkable 95% accuracy rate in the recognition of tumor cells, employing machine learning techniques.

### **Experience**
- Yian attended the HSYLC (Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China program) in August 2019, further demonstrating their commitment to personal and professional development.

### **Publication**
- Yian Pei has co-authored a publication titled "Development and analysis of a novel AF11â€“2 aptamer capable of enhancing the fluorescence of aflatoxin B1," which was featured in the Chinese Chemical Letters in 2022. This publication reflects their contributions to cutting-edge research in the field.
