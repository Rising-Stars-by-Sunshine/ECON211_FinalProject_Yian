# Applying XAI to Heart Failure Prediction Model

## Project information
- **Author**: Yian Pei, Applied Math - Computer science, Class of 2025, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Final Project for [Econ211 Intelligent Economy, 2023 Autumn Term (Seven Week - Second)](https://ms.pubpub.org/) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: I extend my deepest gratitude to Prof. Luyao Zhang, Yiwei Liang, Jiaolun Zhou, Zhe Niu, Enzo Rovira and Zakhar Merinov for their unwavering guidance, expertise, and encouragement, which helped me finish this project.

- **Project Summary**: 
  - This project aims to improve heart failure prediction by integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into a binary classification model. Focused on healthcare, the research utilizes machine learning algorithms and a diverse dataset to enhance transparency and interpretability. The outcomes are expected to yield a refined predictive model, fostering collaboration between healthcare professionals and AI. The intellectual merits lie in advancing healthcare AI, offering transparent and trustworthy models, while the practical impact empowers clinicians with a tool that predicts heart failure and provides understandable insights for improved patient outcomes.

    Research questions:
  - How can SHAP effectively define what clinicians should focus on when predicting heart failure?
  - Will the change of data input (Sex, Age) affect the integration of XAI?

### **Education**
- Yian Pei is currently pursuing a dual degree program at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and Duke University, with an expected graduation in July 2025.

### **Research**
- Yian Pei gained valuable research experience at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO) from July 2019 to August 2021. Working under the guidance of Dr. Jine Wang, Yian actively contributed to a research project focused on the selection of a DNA aptamer for the recognition of Aflatoxin B1 mycotoxin. They were instrumental in developing a fluorescent aptasensor designed for the detection of Aflatoxin B1 in food samples.

### **Professional Experience**
- Yian's professional journey included a summer internship at Ainstec from June 2023 to August 2023, where they served as an Algorithm Engineer Intern. During their time at Ainstec, they led a project in point cloud completion and conducted extensive research to successfully implement dense point-to-point correspondence.

- Additionally, Yian served as a Student Research Intern (Bioinformatics) at SINANO in the same period, where they specialized in image processing and data analysis using ImageJ. They achieved a remarkable 95% accuracy rate in the recognition of tumor cells, employing machine learning techniques.

### **Experience**
- Yian attended the HSYLC (Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China program) in August 2019, further demonstrating their commitment to personal and professional development.

### **Publication**
- Yian Pei has co-authored a publication titled "Development and analysis of a novel AF11–2 aptamer capable of enhancing the fluorescence of aflatoxin B1," which was featured in the Chinese Chemical Letters in 2022. This publication reflects their contributions to cutting-edge research in the field.
