## Description:

The following content is the **LITERATURE** part of the project. This repository presents a research initiative focused on enhancing the interpretability of predictive models for heart failure through the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. The following content provides an overview of the research background, summarizing key literature streams, and highlights how our proposed research builds upon and advances existing studies.

## Literature Review

The proposed research idea focuses on integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into a predictive model for heart failure. To contextualize this research, we explore three streams of relevant literature:

### 1. Similar Research Questions, Different Methods or Application Scenarios

In a study by Wrazen et al. (2023), the potential of machine learning models in predicting patient outcomes, specifically in heart failure management, was investigated. They employed various algorithms and datasets to develop predictive models, emphasizing accurate survival prediction for effective medical management. However, their focus did not include XAI techniques or interpretability.

### 2. Same Methods, Different Questions or Application Scenarios

Aghamohammadi et al. (2019) explored Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), highlighting its role in developing transparent and interpretable models for clinicians. While discussing the general application of XAI in healthcare, their study did not concentrate on heart failure prediction or specific implementation strategies.

### 3. Same Application Scenario, Different Methods or Questions

Another study by Aghamohammadi et al. (2019) focused on enhancing transparency and interpretability in machine learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction. Although they emphasized interpretability in clinical settings, their approach involved rule-based systems rather than integrating XAI techniques into existing machine learning models.

## Connection to Existing Literature

The proposed research builds upon these studies by directly addressing the integration of XAI techniques into a predictive model for heart failure. It aims to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy, crucial for seamless integration into clinical decision-making.

- In contrast to the first stream of literature, our research emphasizes the development of transparent and interpretable models using XAI techniques.
  
- Unlike the second stream, we specifically target heart failure prediction and explore practical implementation strategies.
  
- Compared to the third stream, our research employs machine learning models enriched with XAI techniques, offering improved predictive performance without solely relying on rule-based systems.
