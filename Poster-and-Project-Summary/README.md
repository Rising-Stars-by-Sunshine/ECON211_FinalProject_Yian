## Background/Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating effective identification and proactive management of heart failure. Addressing concerns about machine learning model transparency in clinical settings, this project explores the potential of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically SHAP, in enhancing heart failure prediction.

## Research Question
1. How can SHAP effectively define what people, ie. doctors, should focus on when predicting heart failure?
2. Does the change of data input (Sex, Age) affect the integration of XAI?

## Application Scenarios
In the healthcare landscape, the developed model serves as a crucial tool for clinicians, providing a foundation for early intervention strategies and fostering a proactive approach to cardiovascular health management. The transparency introduced by XAI techniques facilitates informed collaboration between healthcare professionals and AI models.

The models can be trained using other data using the code provided.

## Methodology
The research methodology involves the utilization of a random forest classifier with a dataset comprising multiple numerical and categorical features. Machine learning algorithms will be employed to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients. To enhance transparency and interpretability, Explainable AI techniques will be integrated into the model development process. This includes visualizations, feature importance analyses, and other XAI tools to elucidate the decision-making process of the model.

### SHAP
SHAP, which stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations, is a powerful framework in machine learning for interpreting and understanding the impact of individual features on model predictions. At the core of SHAP is the concept of Shapley values, a mathematical approach rooted in cooperative game theory. In the context of machine learning, SHAP values assign a unique contribution to each feature for a given prediction, revealing the importance of that feature in influencing the model's output.

SHAP values provide a nuanced understanding of feature importance by considering all possible combinations of features and their respective contributions. This holistic approach sets SHAP apart, as it offers a more comprehensive and fair attribution of the impact of each feature within the context of the entire feature set. Incorporating SHAP values into your model interpretation workflow can enhance transparency and foster a deeper understanding of the factors driving model predictions.

## Results
The outcomes of this research are expected to yield a refined predictive model for heart failure, incorporating XAI techniques for improved interpretability. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will be employed to assess the model's performance. Additionally, visualizations and explanations generated by XAI methods will provide insights into the features driving predictions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the model's decision rationale.

## Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts
The intellectual merits of this research lie in advancing the field of healthcare AI by enhancing the interpretability of predictive models. The infusion of XAI techniques not only contributes to the development of more transparent and trustworthy models but also fosters a bridge between machine predictions and clinical decision-making. The practical impact is profound, as the model holds potential for widespread implementation in healthcare settings, empowering clinicians with a tool that not only predicts heart failure but also provides understandable insights into the factors influencing each prediction. Ultimately, this research seeks to usher in a new era of AI in healthcare, where predictive accuracy aligns seamlessly with interpretability, promoting trust and collaboration in the pursuit of improved patient outcomes.
