## Description
This following section provides a summary to the project along with a poster of the project. View other sections for more detailed description.

## Background/Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating effective identification and proactive management of heart failure. Addressing concerns about machine learning model transparency in clinical settings, this project explores the potential of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically SHAP, in enhancing heart failure prediction.

## Research Question
1. How can SHAP be effectively integrated into a predictive model for heart failureï¼Ÿ
2. Does the change of data input (Sex, Age) affect the integration of XAI?

## Application Scenarios
In the healthcare landscape, the developed model serves as a crucial tool for clinicians, providing a foundation for early intervention strategies and fostering a proactive approach to cardiovascular health management. The transparency introduced by XAI techniques facilitates informed collaboration between healthcare professionals and AI models.

## Methodology
Utilizing a random forest classifier with a dataset of numerical and categorical features, machine learning algorithms predict heart failure likelihood. Explainable AI techniques, including SHAP, enhance transparency through visualizations and feature importance analyses.

### SHAP
SHAP, rooted in cooperative game theory, assigns unique contributions to each feature for a given prediction. Its holistic approach offers comprehensive and fair attribution of feature impact, enhancing transparency and understanding.

## Results

## Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts
Advancing healthcare AI, this research enhances model interpretability, fostering collaboration between machine predictions and clinical decision-making. The model's potential widespread implementation empowers clinicians with understandable insights into predictive factors, aiming for improved patient outcomes.
