# Method

## Background/Motivation:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) constitute the primary cause of worldwide mortality, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year and accounting for 31% of all global fatalities (WHO, 2021). Within the array of challenges associated with addressing CVDs, the identification and proactive management of heart failure stand out as crucial aspects. Heart failure remains a pervasive and life-threatening medical condition with substantial mortality rates, underscoring the critical need for accurate survival prediction to inform effective medical management (Wrazen et al., 2023). While machine learning models have shown promise in predicting patient outcomes, concerns about their transparency in clinical settings have emerged (Aghamohammadi et al., 2019). In response, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged, aiming to develop transparent and interpretable models to provide clinicians with insights into the prediction process (Aghamohammadi et al., 2019).

## Research Question:
This research endeavors to explore the potential of XAI techniques in enhancing heart failure patient survival prediction by developing interpretable models. Specifically, the study seeks to address the following research question: "Can the integration of XAI techniques improve the transparency and interpretability of heart failure patient survival prediction models while maintaining or enhancing predictive accuracy?"

## Application Scenarios:
The implications of this research extend to clinical decision support for heart failure, offering assistance to healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about treatment strategies and resource allocation. The successful implementation of the proposed models could lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient resource utilization.

## Data:
The research will utilize a heart failure prediction dataset from a reliable source, incorporating patient demographics, clinical variables, and survival outcomes. This dataset will serve as the foundation for developing and evaluating machine learning models.

## Methodology:
**Model Development:** Train machine learning models for heart failure prediction.

**XAI:** Apply SHAP to apply explainability to the model.

## Results:
The research aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of XAI techniques in improving the transparency and interpretability of heart failure patient prediction models. Results will encompass quantitative model performance metrics and qualitative assessments of model interpretability.

## Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts:
The intellectual merits of this research lie in advancing XAI techniques in the healthcare domain, specifically for heart failure patient survival prediction. Enhanced model interpretability can empower healthcare professionals to make more informed and reliable decisions, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.

## Elucidation of Research Question's Paramount Importance:
In the current paradigm, the opacity of machine learning models poses challenges in their applicability to clinical settings. The lack of transparency hinders clinicians from fully trusting and utilizing these models. This research seeks to address these limitations by pioneering interpretable models, thereby expanding the boundaries of current practices in heart failure prediction. The unique contribution lies in challenging the status quo and bridging the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and practical clinical applications.

## Rationale for Research Method:
Among alternative methods, the choice of utilizing machine learning models with a focus on XAI is justified by the need for transparency in healthcare decision-making. Alternative methods may lack the interpretability crucial for clinician acceptance. The selected method aligns with the research question's objectives, offering a balance between predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

## Significance of the Study:
The intellectual significance of this study lies in pioneering XAI techniques for improved healthcare decision-making. Practically, the outcomes may revolutionize heart failure patient care, potentially garnering recognition such as a Nobel Prize in Economics or Turing Awards in Computing for the groundbreaking contribution in bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and healthcare decision support.
